# Turn-based Conversation
Learn how to implement a simple turn based conversation

## Emulating a simple multi-agent system

In this example we are going to implement an algorithm that emulate a multi-agent system using our neuro-symbolic framework.

To emulate a turn based conversation, you need to describe a loop with an exit condition.
A classic example, is the actor-critic scheme where an agent try to answer while the other critique its work.

```javascript title="conversation.cypher"
CREATE
// Nodes declaration
(start:Control {name:"Start"}),
(end:Control {name:"End"}),
(actor:Program {
    name:"Answer the objective",
    program:"actor"}),
(critic:Program {
    name:"Critique the answer",
    program:"critic"}),
(is_objective_answered:Decision {
    name:"Check if the objective if correctly answered",
    question:"Is the objective correctly answered?"}),
// Structure declaration
(start)-[:NEXT]->(actor),
(actor)-[:NEXT]->(critic),
(critic)-[:NEXT]->(is_objective_answered),
(is_objective_answered)-[:NO]->(actor),
(is_objective_answered)-[:YES]->(end)
```

In order to implement this app properly, we use Program Nodes in order to implement the behavior of our agents in a separate file, this practice allows you to reduce implementation errors and easely modify the behavior of your agents.

Let's implement our agents, create two files: `actor.cypher` and `critic.cypher`.

```javascript title="actor.cypher"
CREATE
// Nodes declaration
(start:Control {name:"Start"}),
(end:Control {name:"End"}),
(answer:Action {
    name:"Answer the objective question",
    tool:"Speak",
    prompt:"Please answer the objective question,Â \
    always reflect on your mistakes"}),
// Structure declaration
(start)-[:NEXT]->(answer),
(answer)-[:NEXT]->(end)
```

```javascript title="critic.cypher"
CREATE
// Nodes declaration
(start:Control {name:"Start"}),
(end:Control {name:"End"}),
(critique:Action {
    name:"Critique the answer",
    tool:"Speak",
    prompt:"Please critique the above answer"}),
// Structure declaration
(start)-[:NEXT]->(critique),
(critique)-[:NEXT]->(end)
```

Now we can implement our main file, and simply call our conversation program:

```javascript title="main.cypher"
CREATE
// Nodes declaration
(start:Control {name:"Start"}),
(end:Control {name:"End"}),
(conversation:Program {
    name:"Emulate a turn-based conversation",
    program:"conversation"}),
// Structure declaration
(start)-[:NEXT]->(conversation),
(conversation)-[:NEXT]->(end)
```

Now you can add a personality to your agents by editing the tool's prompt, or add the use of an additional tool. Feel free to explore the posibilities offered by our framework!
